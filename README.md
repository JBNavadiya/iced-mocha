Iced Mocha Theme
==========

The Iced Mocha Theme by Event Espresso is packed full of features and is fully integrated with Event Espresso 4. This started as a theme for our Event Espresso plugin test drive. We thought others may find it useful, so we have released it on Github in hopes our customers and developers will find it useful and can use it as a starting point for their event registration needs.
